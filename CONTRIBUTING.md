# Contributing to Luos

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs and requests using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and requests.
Report a bug or a request by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions to a driver and/or an application you make will be under the [MIT Software License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
In short, when you submit code changes to drivers and apps, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Any contributions to Luos core technology you make will be under the [Luos License](https://github.com/Luos-io/Luos/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
In short, when you submit code changes to Luos core technology, your submissions are understood to be under the [Luos License](https://github.com/Luos-io/Luos/blob/master/LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Great Bug Reports tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce
* Be specific!
* Give sample code if you can
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
