# Pipe Driver
The pipe driver allow you to share a communication way to the outside world with the other services of your device.

# Pipe configuration
To make this driver work you need to select the HAL corresponding to your needs. To select it you just have to compile the good file by selecting the good folder

## Platformio configuration
If you are using Platformio we already made a script selecting and compiling the files for you depending on some build flags you give him.
To configure it you have to setup `PIPEMODE`and `PIPEHAL` flags.
For example in your platformio.ini

```JSON
...
build_flags =
    -include node_config.h
    -D LUOSHAL=ATSAMD21_ARDUINO
    -D PIPEMODE=SERIAL
    -D PIPEHAL=ARDUINO
...
```
Here is the configuration choices you have : 

| PIPEHAL       | PIPEMODE=SERIAL|  PIPEMODE=BLE | PIPEMODE=WIFI |
| ------------- | -------------  | ------------- | ------------- |
| ARDUINO       | ✅              |               |               |
| NUCLEO-F0     | ✅              |               |               |
| NUCLEO-F4     | ✅              |               |               |
| NUCLEO-G431   | ✅              |               |               |
| NUCLEO-G474   | ✅              |               |               |
| NUCLEO-L4     | ✅              |               |               |
