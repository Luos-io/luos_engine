# Luos Technology
## The most for the developer​
Luos provides a simple way to think your hardware products as a group of independant features. You can easily manage and share your hardware products' features with your team, external developers, or with the community. Luos is an open-source lightweight library that can be used on any MCU, leading to free and fast multi-electronic-boards products development. Choosing Luos to design a product will help you to develop, debug, validate, monitor, and manage it from the cloud.

## The most for the community​
Most of the embedded developments are made from scratch. By using Luos, you will be able to capitalize on the development you, your company, or the Luos community already did. The re-usability of features encapsulated in Luos services will fasten the time your products reach the market and reassure the robustness and the universality of your applications.
